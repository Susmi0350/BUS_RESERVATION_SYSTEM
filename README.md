# BUS_RESERVATION_SYSTEM
In this project we used remote operations for selecting reservation, cancellation of booking, and finally exit.  
We used file handling for storing the data in the bus reservstion of a person.We used the text type file in the project which makes easier of our project but it is not much secure ,we can use the binary search which makes us more difficult for us to use.
Here we used file handling for numbers file and names file.
It is a small project we faced difficulty in adding the bus status board in the reservation system.
